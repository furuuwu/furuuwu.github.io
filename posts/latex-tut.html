        <h2>Simple LaTeX Example</h2>
        <p>Here is an example of a LaTeX equation:</p>
        <p>$$E = mc^2$$</p>
        <p>And here is a more complex one:</p>
        <p>
            $$\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$$
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, inline LaTeX can be used, such as \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).</p>

        <h3>Delimiting your LaTeX code</h3>
        <p>You must put special delimiters at the beginning and end of your LaTeX code, in order for MathJax to
            recognize it and process it. If you want the equation to appear inline with the surrounding text, put ##
            before and after it. If you want the equation to stand alone in a separate "paragraph", centered
            horizontally on the screen as in most textbooks, put $$ before and after it. Here's an example, first with
            the delimiters disabled so you can see the raw code:</p>
        <p>Here's an example, first with the delimiters disabled so you can see the raw code:</p>
        <p>A quadratic equation is of the form <code>\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\)</code>. To solve for x, use the quadratic
            formula <code>$$x = \frac {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 -4ac}} {2a},$$</code> substituting the values of the
            coefficients a, b and c.</p>
        <p>And now with the delimiters enabled so as to render the equations:</p>
        <p>A quadratic equation is of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). To solve for x, use the quadratic formula $$x =
            \frac {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 -4ac}} {2a},$$ substituting the values of the coefficients a, b and c.</p>
        <p>Hereafter, I will omit the delimiters in code examples, to save space.</p>
