    <h1>Gacha games</h1>
    <p>One of today's problems is the lack of conditions to see the night sky...</p>
    <p>With our busy lifestyle and the abundance of entertainment options, most people just don't stare at the stars
        anymore and that source of wonder is lost...</p>
    <p>With no sense of wonder and humility, it is increasingly difficult to grasp the bigger picture of our place as
        Humans in the universe...</p>

    <br>
    <p>The solution is of course gacha games</p>
    <br>
    <p>So, in here i list some suggestions and comment on our options to help you live a intentful life</p>

    <p>"But Ricardo", you annoyingly point out, "isn't that because of light pollution? How is homelessness going to
        solve the problem?"</p>

    <p>STOP MAKING EXCUSES YOU LIL BITCH</p>

    <br>
    <p>Anyways here goes the lists</p>


    <p>for pc (important for me, i rather not use emulators):</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Honkai: Star Rail
            <br>
            by far the best way to efficiently get rid of your life savings. The story is usually interesting, they pump
            enough content without it becoming overwelming because the game is autobattler and takes less time/effort.
            The powercreep is real but you can do most endgame despite as f2p
        </li>
        <li>
            Snowbreak: Containment Zone
            <br>
            the story is boring, i don't read it. The gameplay is enjoyable, story missions are quick and most are easy,
            the waifu housing is a good idea but feels lifeless. Update: these bastards are phasing out the english
            voice acting sadly
        </li>
        <li>
            Genshin Impact
            <br>
            story is interesting, lots of waifus to collect, but gets tiring after a while (there is no way you'll be
            able to do the daily missions for more than a few months... unless you are masochist or smt). The Spiral
            Abyss last levels are tough
        </li>
        <li>
            Reverse: 1999
            <br>
            British waifus. The voice acting is generally good. The story is a bit... confusing. It's very creative most
            of the time, they prob are doing mushrooms.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wuthering Waves
            <br>
            I love it already! For now I'm building Rover Havov, Jianxin and Sanshua.
        </li>
        <li>
            AFK Journey
            <br>
            Well, for now i'm playing it. I don't like the constant attempts at making you spend money and I'm not going
            to spend any on it. I'm sure it works as a financial strategy but if you have to force it, it's just sad
            man.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p></p>i've stopped these (because the day only has 24h and i spend more than half sleeping):
    <ul>
        <li>CounterSide
            <br>
            this is garbage but i kept playing this for a unreasonable amout of time, till one day i stopped. Obviously.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dragonheir
            <br>
            The story is GOOD. I stopped cause there was a reset which i didn't understand or appreciate. Also, the
            grind is hell. But of those in this list, this is one of the best.
        </li>
        <li>
            Limbus Company
            <br>
            Another great game, in terms of story. The battles aren't super exciting ofc (autobate mode always gets the
            job done). A positive aspect is there is little to no incentive to spend on the gacha pulling.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Seven Deadly Sins: Grand Cross
            <br>
            story is boring obviously since you already seen it before in the anime, the events are boring, the gamplay
            itself is boring and the only reason to play this is the cancerous pvp
        </li>
        <li>
            Solo Leveling
            <br>
            Not bad but not good either.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p>other (i skipped):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Tower of Fantasy
            <br>
            didn't play it enough to comment on it fairly
        </li>
        <li>
            Punishing Gray Raven
            <br>
            can't say much but story seems meh and the controls are hard. update: maybe i just suck at gaming and life
            in general so i stopped
        </li>
        <li>
            Honkai Impact 3rd
            <br>
            played it for a while but on pc i didn't feel it was polished enough
        </li>
        <li>
            Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds
            <br>
            beautiful. But no time. ðŸ˜ž
