    <h1>Diary (or self-venting or talking to myself)</h1>
    <p>This is a subset of what is pretty much a diary, only of a less private nature.</p>
    <br>

    <div>
        <p><em>17/08/2024</em></p>
        <p>Given the poor experiences i've had in the past, i've decided moving foward i'll no longer dm/text women in
            general.
        </p>
        <p>Except those in my family ofc, or if it is strictly for work.</p>
        <p>If i want to, beyond that scenario, i'll just talk in person or call. It just feels fake. Also, if someone
            happens to want to flirt,
            do it to my face.</p>
        <p>Ofc i'll keep talking to anyone and even being flirty or saying stupid shit in foruns/channels because i like
            to, but only in "public".</p>
        <p>I'm more than done with dating apps, and i'm keeping my decision to not follow people on social media or
            streamers.</p>
        <p>Dating apps are cancer, following girls on social media or streaming platforms is for boys and parasocial
            relationships are cringe.</p>
        <p>Besides, I'm peak antisocial anyways.</p>
